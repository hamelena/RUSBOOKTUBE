# RUSBOOKTUBE

The data set was created in August-October 2021 as part of a research project on Russian Booktube. Research results will be published in the 14th issue of the peer-reviewed Apparatus Journal (2022:14) in Russian. Data on videos were collected with youtube-dl (development status August 2021). Only officially, public-accessed data were collected.

The full dataset was published in JLU PUB: https://jlupub.ub.uni-giessen.de/handle/jlupub/2203

On Github, two visualizations are published: the visualization of the dataset as an interactive table (EHAMIDY_Booktube_dataset_interactive_table.html) and an interactive graph (EHAMIDY_Booktube_genres.html) showing the number of videos by date and category.
